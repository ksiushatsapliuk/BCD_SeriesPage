    <p>The plot of the series is built around the theme of marital infidelity and how 
        betrayal can lead to murder.</p>
    <h2>Season 1: Three Women, One House</h2>
    <p>The first season tells about women living in one mansion at three different times:</p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li><b>1963 (Beth Ann):</b> An exemplary housewife discovers that her husband is 
            having an affair with a waitress. Trying to save the marriage, she begins 
            to secretly be friends with her husband's mistress, but gradually realizes 
            the true nature of her husband.</li>
        <li><b>1984 (Symona):</b> The socialite finds out that her husband is gay. While she 
            tries to save face in front of society and plans a divorce, she has an affair 
            with the 18-year-old son of her best friend.</li>
        <li><b>2019 (Taylor):</b> A successful lawyer is openly married. Problems begin when 
            she brings her lover Jade into the house, with whom her husband eventually 
            falls in love.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The action takes place in the same mansion in Pasadena, but in three different 
        decades. Each heroine learns about her husband's infidelity, which triggers a 
        chain of events leading to a fatal outcome.</p>

    <h2>Season 2: Price of recognition</h2>
    <p>The action is transferred to 1949. The plot focuses on one timeline and new characters.</p>
    <ul type="circle">
        <li><b>Alma Fillcot:</b> A modest housewife whose main dream is to get into the prestigious 
            garden club headed by the glamorous Rita Castillo.</li>
        <li><b>The husband's secret:</b> Alma accidentally learns that her husband Bertram 
            (a good-natured veterinarian) is a serial killer who "out of mercy" euthanizes 
            terminally ill people.</li>
        <li><b>Transformation:</b> Instead of betraying her husband, Alma begins to use his methods 
            to hide her secrets and pave the way to social success, gradually turning from 
            a victim into a dangerous manipulator.</li>
    </ul>
