    <h2>Season 1: Three Women, One House</h2>
    <p>The first season tells about women living in one mansion at three different times:</p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li id="stantons"><b>1963: Beth Ann and Rob</b> Beth Ann tries to win her husband back by 
            befriending his lover April. However, she learns the terrible truth: their 
            common daughter did not die by accident (as she believed for years), but 
            because of Rob's negligence.<br><b>Murder:</b> Beth Ann decides not to kill 
            the ego with her own hands. She arranges the situation so that Rob is shot by 
            their armed abusive neighbor, who found out about his wife's (false) adultery 
            with Rob.</li>
        <img src="1963.jpg" height="200"></img>
        <li id="grooves"><b>1984: Simona and Karl:</b> Simona plans a divorce when she learns about 
            Karl's orientation, but her anger is replaced by sympathy when it turns out 
            that Karl has AIDS. Their story line is the most touching in the season: she 
            stays with him until the end, despite the condemnation of society and her 
            affair with Tommy.<br><b>Murder:</b> Formally, this is an assisted suicide. 
            When Karl becomes very ill, Simona helps him to leave his life in their home, 
            dancing the last dance with him.</li>
            <img src="1984.webp" height="200"></img>
        <li id="harding"><b>2019: Taylor, Eli and Jade:</b> Jade seems like the perfect "third" in the 
            couple's relationship, but it soon turns out that she is a dangerous sociopath 
            with a criminal past. She puts Ilya on drugs in order to control his money and 
            stay in the mansion.<br><b>Murder:</b> In the final fight in the house, Jade 
            attacks the couple with a knife. After a fierce fight, Taylor kills Jade, 
            protecting herself and Eli.</li>
            <img src="2019.webp" height="200"></img>
    </ol>
    <p>The action takes place in the same mansion in Pasadena, but in three different 
        decades. Each heroine learns about her husband's infidelity, which triggers a 
        chain of events leading to a fatal outcome.</p>

    <h2>Season 2: Price of recognition</h2>
    <p>The second season is a complete noir story, which takes place in 1949. The plot 
        revolves around the desire of the "little man" for power and recognition.</p>

        to eliminate anyone (including friends and neighbors) who stands in her way to the 
        status of "first lady" of the club.</p>
